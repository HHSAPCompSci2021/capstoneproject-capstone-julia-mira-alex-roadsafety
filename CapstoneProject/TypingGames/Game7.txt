At Gagosians booth at Frieze New York, you can find an array of abstractions by Albert Oehlen, whose works have sold for sums in the low millions at auction. At most fair booths, this would be the main attraction, but here, it was something entirely different that was luring people in the events early hours: a functional vending machine plopped down in the center of Gagosians space that drew a short line just after 11 a.m.
On offer is a bunch of bottles containing Kafftee, otherwise known as Cofftea, a coffee-tea hybrid that is available for the taking. Each has on it a label that appears to be a drawing by Oehlen depicting a hand with a watch whose arms are spinning out of control. The drinks producer, Aqua Monaco, ominously promises on its website that Cofftea will never let you sleep again. ARTnews can neither confirm nor deny that statement as of press time for this article, but the day is still young. The drink certainly does taste strongly of caffeine.
Cofftea is, in some sense, an artwork, and it has appeared at museums such as the Serpentine Galleries in London, the Palazzo Grassi in Venice, and the Aishti Foundation in Beirut. (The Cofftea at Frieze is available for free, and it cannot be bought as an artwork, a Gagosian representative said.) That may seem unusual until you consider that theres at least one forerunner for this piece. Oehlens stunt recalls the Soylent drinks that artist Sean Raspet brought to Frieze New York in 2016.
To obtain your very own Cofftea, youll need a token being given out by Gagosian representatives at the booth. (The tokens are emblazoned with Oehlens initials and the gallerys namea nice touch.) You then insert the token into the vending machine, which bears the phrase THEY ARE COMING TO TAKE ME AWAY on its side, and out comes a bottle once you punch in a number corresponding to each row.
