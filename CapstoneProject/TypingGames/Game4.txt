March 25 is Dante Day, celebrated as Danted� in Italy, to honor the timeless achievements of writer/poet Dante Alighieri. He is considered the father of the modern Italian
 language because of his famed manuscripts, such as the Divine Comedy (Commedia in Italian), one of the greatest works of European literature. Dante was also a soldier in 
 his early years and always ambitious in the politics of Florence, his birthplace. Tragically, his views landed him on the losing side. His party, the White Guelphs, 
 supported freedom from papal interference in Florentine affairs. The opposing Black Guelphs supported the pope in Rome. After much intrigue and changes of government, the
 Black Guelphs triumphed.   
Dante wrote the Divine Comedy in the vernacular, or common language, of his day, which he called Italian. (Most writing at the time was done in Latin, which only the most educated
 could read.) Part prose and part poetry, the Divine Comedy describes Dante�s journey through Hell (Inferno), Purgatory (Purgatorio), and Paradise (Paradiso), guided first
 by the ancient Roman poet Virgil and then by his beloved Beatrice.
 The National Gallery�s Allegorical Portrait of Dante depicts the poet sitting on a rock, his distinctive profile leaving no doubt as to his identity. He turns to look across the water at small figures
 walking along the elevated circles of Purgatory, where souls await purification before admission to Paradise. His right hand hovers in a protective or resolute gesture over the bell tower and cathedral 
 (Duomo) of Florence, illuminated from below by flickering flames, perhaps of Hell itself. In his left hand is a large manuscript copy of his masterpiece opened to the 25th Canto of Paradise. 
 Legible lines focus on Dante�s desperate hope and longing to return to the place of his birth after so many years in exile.
Dante writes of the wolves and the lambs of war, the cruelty of the strong over the weak. Seven hundred years after his death such evocations have relevance again, as they often have had throughout history.
