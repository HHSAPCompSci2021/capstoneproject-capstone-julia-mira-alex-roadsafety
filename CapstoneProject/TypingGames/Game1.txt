All the ladies of the city would compete . . . to have meetings in the company of the virtuous young woman one period source said of Lavinia Fontanaand to have their portraits painted by her hand.
We know too little about the daily lives of Italian Renaissance and baroque women artists. I often think about what it would have been like to have a portrait done by Fontana in late 1500s Bologna. I imagine that it may have gone something like this.
Costanza Alidosi, a Bolognese noblewoman of substantial years and experience, waits patiently in the antechamber of Fontanas studio. Not wanting to be late for this greatly anticipated occasion, Costanza had rushed over with her King Charles spaniel Lucrezia in tow. She had tried for monthsnay, yearsto get a slot on Fontanas calendar.
Costanza eschewed the custom of only being painted on the occasion of her betrothal or as a widow. Her husband Ridolfo Isolani, a distinguished nobleman and a close associate of the Medici family in Florence, was still alive and well. But if Lavinia Fontana could excel as a woman painter, Costanza reasoned, she could have her portrait painted simply because she desired oneand because she was curious about the artist.
As she was musing, the studios door flew open and a valet in fine burgundy velvet greeted her with a bow, offering a refreshment. Costanza declined, eager to meet the artist. The valet escorted her to the threshold of the studio, relieving her of an ornate gown of brocade, velvet, and silk. At her advanced age, it was too cumbersome and heavy to don except when necessary, but Costanza intended to have Fontana copy it for her portrait.
Lucrezia, who yelped once in excitement, was also there to be part of the painting. She would signify Costanzas loyalty to her husband, even though in reality the dog had allegiance only to her mistress.
