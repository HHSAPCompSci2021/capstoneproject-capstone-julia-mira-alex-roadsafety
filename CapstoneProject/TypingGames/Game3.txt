Color is one of the most powerful tools for visual communication. It can influence our emotions, 
our mood, and our behavior. Thats why its so important for product designers to select colors carefully.
In this article, well explore the basics of color theory for designers and provide information to help you design effective and visually interesting color schemes.
Color is an essential part of human-computer interaction, and similar to other elements like typography, designers should select colors with care. 
Color scheme is a term that designers use to describe color combinations that they use in GUI design. Since there are infinite color combinations 
out there, it can be hard to decide what color scheme will work the best for your product. Fortunately, we have color theory, a discipline 
that helps us select balanced and effective color combinations.Here are a few practical recommendations from color theory that will help you 
select powerful color combinations for your design system.
Achieving harmony in color combinations is one of the main color theory principles. When you create a new scheme, it might be tempting to add 
dozens of colors to it. But its better to avoid that temptation. Why? Because its really hard to achieve a visual balance when you use too many colors.
You can also easily overwhelm your users. So how do you avoid this? Keep your color scheme simple, with a maximum of two or three colors. Some designers think 
that two or three colors will limit their creativity, but thats not true. Its possible to create interesting visual combinations by playing with shades and 
tints of those colors. Simple schemes also work best for your users.
